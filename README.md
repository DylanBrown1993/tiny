## Using the TinyApp
TinyApp gives you the ability to shorten URLs. This is handy when sharing links or embedding them into other sites and apps!

## Registering
You can register using your email and picking a password, which will give you access to an index of all your shortened URLs.

## Creating new URLs
All you have to do is paste the URL you want to shorten into the URL field and click submit. This will provide you with a shortened link to share.

## Editing URLs
You can ammend and edit your URLs at any time using the edit button. This is useful if the original long URL is no longer valid.

## Deleting URLs
If you no longer need a shortened URL, you can also delete from the my URLs page.
